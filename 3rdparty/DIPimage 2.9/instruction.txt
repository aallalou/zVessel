These instructions explain how to start DIPimage in MATLAB:

1. start MATLAB
2. execute the command run('D:\!2018 OPT Project\MATLAB\DIPlib\DIPimage 2.9\dipstart.m')

Optionally, you can create or modify the startup.m file in
the default working directory of MATLAB to run 'dipstart.m'
automatically at the beginning of every session.
